# Deploy to Netlify - Step by Step Guide

Your project is ready to deploy! Follow these steps to deploy your Price Elasticity Quiz to Netlify using the web UI.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account (or GitLab/Bitbucket)
- A Netlify account (free at netlify.com)

## Step 1: Push Your Project to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it "price-elasticity" or "price-elasticity-quiz"
   - Make it public or private (your choice)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. Push your local project to GitHub:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/tarasbobrovytsky/Dev/price-elasticity
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Price Elasticity Quiz"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Deploy on Netlify

1. **Log in to Netlify**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Create New Site**
   - Click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub

3. **Select Your Repository**
   - Search for your repository name
   - Click on your repository

4. **Configure Build Settings**
   Netlify should auto-detect these, but verify:
   - **Branch to deploy**: main
   - **Base directory**: _(leave empty)_
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `.next`
   - **Functions directory**: (leave empty)

5. **Environment Variables** (if needed)
   - No environment variables are needed for this project

6. **Deploy Site**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

## Step 3: Your Site is Live! ðŸŽ‰

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://amazing-newton-123456.netlify.app`

You can:
- **Custom Domain**: Add your own domain in Site settings â†’ Domain management
- **Rename Site**: Change the subdomain in Site settings â†’ Site details
- **Enable Auto-Deploy**: Any push to GitHub will automatically redeploy

## Important Notes

âœ… The `netlify.toml` file is already configured for Next.js
âœ… The project has been tested and builds successfully
âœ… All dependencies are properly listed in package.json
âœ… The dataset.json is in the public folder and will be served correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build Failed**: Check the deploy log in Netlify for specific errors
2. **404 Errors**: Make sure the publish directory is set to `.next`
3. **Missing Styles**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is building properly (it should be)

## After Deployment

Share your quiz with friends and test their knowledge of price elasticity! The site will work perfectly on all devices with beautiful animations and a professional look.

Enjoy your deployed Price Elasticity Quiz! ðŸš€
